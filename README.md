# J4LA
### Julia for Linear Algebra
J4LA is a simple repository used to store my Linear Algebra classwork.  All scripts will be written as Julia (.jl) script files.  

### How to run .jl files
1. Add julia to your PATH enviroment variable (c:/path/to/julia/bin)
2. Run the following command from the terminal:
```
julia script_name.jl
```

For example, to run the initialTest script, simply enter:
```
julia initialTest.jl
```
